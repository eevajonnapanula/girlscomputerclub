## Getting started

This project uses Django and Python 3. To get started, set up a virtual environment in the repository and activate it. Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Django.

Migrate the sqlite3 database: `python manage.py migrate` 

Start the application: `python manage.py runserver` 

Create a admin for the project: `python manage.py createsuperuser`  

You can now log into `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to modify the site.
